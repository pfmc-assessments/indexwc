#' Calculate area-specific indices between each set of boundaries
#'
#' Calculate annual estimates of biomass (mt) for each area specified in
#' `boundaries`. The boundaries can be any configuration as long as all
#' boundaries lie within the overall grid; they can even be overlapping.
#' The more boundaries there are the longer the function will take to run.
#'
#' @details
#' The outer areas will be truncated based on the presence of positive tows
#' such that the most northern and southern extents of adjoining areas will
#' not extrapolate into areas where positive tows are not observed at least
#' once. This is helpful for species that are sparsely sampled because model
#' convergence is poor when there are a lot of zeros.

#' @param boundaries A named list of northern and southern boundaries for a
#'   set of areas. The list can contain as many areas as you would like but
#'   it must contain at least one area and each area must be a vector of two
#'   real numbers specified in decimal degrees. The order of the areas only
#'   matters if you care what order they are plotted because the names will
#'   be turned into factors. The default value uses a data object called
#'   `boundaries_data`, which is a list of several areas along the U.S. West
#'   Coast, including a coastwide area going from the northern Washington
#'   border to the southern California border.

#' @return
#' A very large list is returned with predictions, model fits, and indices for
#' each area specified in boundaries. Potentially, two figures are also saved
#' to the disk displaying the index by year. The index for each area is also
#' saved to a csv file in `dir` titled `est_by_area.csv`.
