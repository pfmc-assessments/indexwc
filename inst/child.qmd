### \gls{`r text_survey`}

The data were truncated to depths less than `r ifelse(abs(max_depth) == "Inf", "the maximum depth surveyed", abs(max_depth))` m prior to modelling given that there were `r xfun::numbers_to_words(NROW(data_discards))` positive encounters in depths deeper than `r abs(max_depth)` m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between `r abs(min_depth)`--`r abs(max_depth)` m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects.

The model used a delta model with a `r distribution` distribution for the catch-rate component.
A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates.
The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year.
`r text_covariates`
Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey,
were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects
were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of
vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of
commercial vessels used during sampling
[@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].


```{asis, echo = data$common_name[1] != "canary rockfish"}
Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was included in the encounter
probability and the positive catch rate model.
```
Spatial variation was approximated using `r n_knots` knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.
