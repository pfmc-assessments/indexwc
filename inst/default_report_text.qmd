## Survey indices of abundance

Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to survey data using \gls{tmb}
[@kristensen_tmb:_2016] via the R package \gls{sdmtmb} [@Anderson:2022:SRP].
These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random
field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random
field [@thorson_geostatistical_2015]. Tweedie, delta-binomial, delta-gamma, and mixture distributions, which
allow for extreme catch events, were investigated. Results are only shown for
the distribution that led to the best model diagnostics, e.g., similar
distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles, high
precision, lack of extreme predictions that are incompatible with the life
history, and low \gls{aic}. Estimates of biomass from this best model were
predicted using a grid based on available survey locations. The {indexwc} R 
package [@johnson_indexwc_2025] was used to conduct the analysis and code to
reproduce the analysis is available at
https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/indexwc.

### West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey
<!-- ### \gls{s-wcgbt} -->
```{r} 
#| echo: false 
#| eval: true 
load(here::here("data/configuration.rda")) # not sure if this is needed
source(here::here("R/get_info.R"))
info <- get_info(species = "yellowtail rockfish", source = "NWFSC.Combo")

```


`r info$truncation_text`
`r info$grid_text`

The model used a delta model with a `r info$dist` distribution for the catch-rate component.
A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates.
The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year.
`r info$covariates_text`
Vessel-year effects, which have traditionally been included in index standardization for this survey,
were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects
were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and were included for each unique combination of
vessel and year in the data to account for the random selection of
commercial vessels used during sampling
[@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014].

`r info$spatiotemporal_text` Spatial variation was approximated using `r info$knots` knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors because the positive encounters are too sparse to support the dense spatiotemporal structure.

### Triennial Survey
<!-- ### \gls{s-tri} -->

```{r} 
#| echo: false 
#| eval: true 
load(here::here("data/configuration.rda")) # not sure if this is needed
source(here::here("R/get_info.R"))
info <- get_info(species = "yellowtail rockfish", source = "NWFSC.Combo")
```

Vessel-year effects, which were included in some index standardizations for this survey up to 2021,
were not included as the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects
